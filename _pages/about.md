My name is Sibi Catley-Chandar and I'm currently a computer vision researcher at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab London](https://noahlab.com.hk/#/home) and also a doctoral student at Queen Mary, University of London. 

My research interests are in computational photography (high dynamic range imaging) and 3D reconstruction of scenes with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). I'm especially interested in ways to use statistical modelling of the image formation process to improve current deep learning methods and challenge existing assumptions. 

I'm lucky to be supervised by [Dr. Eduardo Perez Pellitero](https://perezpellitero.github.io/) at Huawei and [Professor Greg Slabaugh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/slabaughgreg.html) and [Dr. Martin Benning](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/benningmartin.html) at Queen Mary.

Outside of research I enjoy road cycling, running, skiing and walking our dogs.
